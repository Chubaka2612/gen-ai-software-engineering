# PLAN.md — AiTicketHub Support Ticket API

## Project Overview

AI-assisted implementation of a Support Ticket Management REST API using .NET 9 and Clean Architecture. Every phase is executed by a specific AI agent using a designated skill file.

**Status markers:** `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocked

---

## Workflow Sequence

```
create-project-layout → create-structure → implement-feature
   → create-parser + create-endpoint (import)
   → create-endpoint (auto-classify)
   → create-tests
   → create-docs
```

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation

**Goal:** Bootstrap the .NET 9 solution with all projects, project references, NuGet packages, and foundational domain types.

- [x] Generate `AiTicketHub.Infrastructure.csproj` (references Application)
- [x] Generate `AiTicketHub.API.csproj` (references Application + Infrastructure; FluentValidation.AspNetCore 11.x)
- [x] Generate `AiTicketHub.Tests.csproj` (references API; NUnit 4.x, FluentAssertions 6.x, Moq 4.x, Mvc.Testing)
- [x] Create all empty folders with `.gitkeep`
- [x] Create `Domain/Common/Error.cs` and `Domain/Common/Result.cs`
- [x] Create empty DI stubs: `ApplicationServiceExtensions.cs`, `InfrastructureServiceExtensions.cs`
- [x] Create `API/Program.cs` skeleton with three wiring calls

**Prompt trigger:**
```
Load agents/architect.md and skills/create-project-layout.md.

Bootstrap the AiTicketHub solution.
Solution name:    AiTicketHub
Target framework: net9.0
```

**Completion check:** `dotnet build AiTicketHub.sln` exits with code 0 and all five projects compile with no errors.

---

## Phase 1 — Ticket Entity Structure

**Goal:** Define all contracts for the Ticket entity across every Clean Architecture layer — no method bodies, no test code.

**Agent:** Architect (`agents/architect.md`)
**Skill:** `skills/create-structure.md`

### Tasks

- [x] Define `Domain/Entities/Ticket.cs` skeleton (properties + constructor signature)
- [x] Define `Domain/Enums/TicketCategory.cs` (account_access | technical_issue | billing_question | feature_request | bug_report | other)
- [x] Define `Domain/Enums/TicketPriority.cs` (urgent | high | medium | low)
- [x] Define `Domain/Enums/TicketStatus.cs` (new | in_progress | waiting_customer | resolved | closed)
- [x] Define `Domain/Enums/TicketSource.cs` (web_form | email | api | chat | phone)
- [x] Define `Domain/Enums/DeviceType.cs` (desktop | mobile | tablet)
- [x] Populate `Domain/Common/Errors.cs` with all error codes (NotFound, InvalidStatus, Duplicate, ValidationFailed)
- [x] Define `Application/Interfaces/ITicketService.cs` (5 method signatures: Create, GetById, List, Update, Delete)
- [x] Define `Application/Interfaces/ITicketRepository.cs` (matching repository signatures)
- [x] Create Request + Response DTO pairs for each operation (9 files — DeleteTicket has no DTOs)
- [x] Create validator class skeletons for writable operations (Create, Update — empty constructors)
- [x] Output DI registration note

**Prompt trigger:**
```
Load agents/architect.md and skills/create-structure.md.

Design the structure for the Ticket entity.

Entity name:    Ticket
Entity fields:  Id: Guid, CustomerId: string, CustomerEmail: string,
                CustomerName: string, Subject: string, Description: string,
                Category: TicketCategory, Priority: TicketPriority,
                Status: TicketStatus, CreatedAt: DateTime, UpdatedAt: DateTime,
                ResolvedAt: DateTime?, AssignedTo: string?,
                Tags: List<string>, Source: TicketSource,
                Browser: string?, DeviceType: DeviceType
Enums needed:   TicketCategory, TicketPriority, TicketStatus, TicketSource, DeviceType
Operations:     CreateTicket, GetTicketById, ListTickets, UpdateTicket, DeleteTicket
Business rules: Subject 1–200 chars; Description 10–2000 chars;
                CustomerEmail must be valid email format;
                Status transitions: new→in_progress→waiting_customer→resolved→closed only;
                Resolved or closed tickets cannot be deleted
```

**Completion check:** All 20+ files exist; no method body contains logic; `dotnet build` still passes.

---

## Phase 2 — Core CRUD Implementation

**Goal:** Fill every method body for the five CRUD operations across Domain, Repository, Validators, Service, and Controller layers.

**Agent:** Implementer (`agents/developer.md`)
**Skill:** `skills/implement-feature.md`

- [x] Fill `CreateTicketValidator.cs` rule chains (subject, description, email)
- [x] Fill `UpdateTicketValidator.cs` rule chains
- [x] Implement `TicketService.cs` (all 5 methods: validate → repository → map DTO → return Result)
- [x] Implement `TicketController.cs` (all 5 actions with uniform `{"code":"...","message":"..."}` error envelope)
- [x] Wire DI: `ITicketService → TicketService` (Scoped) in `AddApplicationServices`
- [x] Wire DI: `ITicketRepository → TicketRepository` (Singleton) in `AddInfrastructureServices`

**Prompt trigger:**

```

**Completion check:** `POST /tickets/import` with a valid CSV returns `200 OK` with `{"total":N,"successful":M,"failed":K,"errors":[]}`.

---

## Phase 4 — Auto-Classification Endpoint

**Goal:** Implement `POST /tickets/:id/auto-classify` that assigns category and priority from keyword analysis and returns confidence score with reasoning.

**Agent:** Implementer (`agents/developer.md`)
**Skill:** `skills/create-endpoint.md`

### Tasks

Create a new endpoint for the AiTicketHub Support Ticket API.
Method:          POST
Route:           /tickets/{id}/auto-classify
Operation name:  AutoClassify
Entity:          Ticket
Request fields:  (none required — id comes from route)
Response fields: Category: TicketCategory, Priority: TicketPriority,
                 Confidence: double, Reasoning: string,
                 KeywordsFound: List<string>
Business rules:  Ticket must exist (Ticket.NotFound if not);
                 Urgent keywords: "can't access","critical","production down","security";
                 High keywords: "important","blocking","asap";
                 Low keywords: "minor","cosmetic","suggestion";
                 Medium is default priority;
                 Category matched by login/password/2FA → account_access,
                 payment/invoice/refund → billing_question,
                 bug/error/crash + reproduction → bug_report,
                 enhancement/suggestion → feature_request,
                 other errors → technical_issue, else → other;
                 Confidence 0.0–1.0 (keyword-hit ratio);
                 Log every classification decision
```

**Completion check:** `POST /tickets/{id}/auto-classify` on an existing ticket returns `200 OK` with confidence score ≥ 0 and ≤ 1 and a non-empty `reasoning` field.

---

## Phase 5 — Test Suite

**Goal:** Generate a comprehensive test suite achieving >85% code coverage across all layers.

**Agent:** Test Engineer (`agents/test-engineer.md`)
**Skill:** `skills/create-tests.md`

### Tasks

**Unit tests — Application layer:**

- [x] `tests/Application/TicketServiceTests.cs` — GetTicketById (found, not found)
- [x] `tests/Application/TicketServiceTests.cs` — ListTickets (empty, filtered, paged)
- [x] `tests/Application/TicketServiceTests.cs` — UpdateTicket (valid, not found, invalid status transition)
- [x] `tests/Application/TicketServiceTests.cs` — DeleteTicket (valid, not found, resolved/closed rejection)
- [x] `tests/Application/TicketServiceTests.cs` — ImportTickets (all success, partial failure, all failure)
- [x] `tests/Application/TicketServiceTests.cs` — AutoClassify (each category, each priority, not found)

- [x] `tests/API/IntegrationTests.cs` — bulk import → auto-classify all imported tickets
- [x] `tests/API/IntegrationTests.cs` — 20 concurrent CreateTicket requests (no data race)
- [x] `tests/API/IntegrationTests.cs` — combined filter by category AND priority
- [x] `tests/API/PerformanceTests.cs` — ListTickets benchmark (1000 tickets, p95 < 200 ms)

**Coverage:**

- [x] Run `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`
- [x] Verify overall line coverage > 85% — achieved 93.8% line / 76.3% branch
- [x] Save coverage report; take screenshot to `docs/screenshots/test_coverage.png`

**Prompt trigger:**
```
Load agents/test-engineer.md and skills/create-tests.md.

Generate the full test suite for the Ticket entity.

Entity:                  Ticket
Service method:          Task<Result<CreateTicketResponse>> CreateTicketAsync(CreateTicketRequest)
Contracts at:            src/AiTicketHub
Coverage target:         >85%
Test framework:          NUnit 4.x + FluentAssertions 6.x + Moq 4.x
```
*(Repeat for each operation or run one pass covering all operations.)*

**Completion check:** `dotnet test` shows all tests green; coverage report shows line coverage ≥ 85%.

## Phase 7 — Delivery

**Goal:** Produce all sample data files, verify deliverables, and package the submission.

**Agent:** Implementer (`agents/developer.md`) for sample data; manual for final review.
**Skill:** None (manual tasks).

### Tasks

**Sample data:**
- [ ] Generate `tests/fixtures/sample_tickets.csv` — 50 valid tickets covering all enum values
- [ ] Generate `tests/fixtures/sample_tickets.json` — 20 valid tickets as JSON array
- [ ] Generate `tests/fixtures/sample_tickets.xml` — 30 valid tickets as XML document
- [ ] Generate `tests/fixtures/invalid_tickets.csv` — intentionally malformed rows for negative tests
- [ ] Generate `tests/fixtures/invalid_tickets.json` — missing required fields, wrong types
- [ ] Generate `tests/fixtures/invalid_tickets.xml` — malformed XML for negative tests

**Prompt trigger (sample data):**
```
Load agents/developer.md.

Generate sample data files for AiTicketHub testing.
Formats:    CSV (50 tickets), JSON (20 tickets), XML (30 tickets)
Also generate invalid variants for each format (5–10 malformed records each).

## Decision Log

| Date | Phase | Decision | Rationale | Made By |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 2026-05-06 | 0 | Added non-generic `Result` class alongside `Result<T>` | Enables void-return operations (e.g. Delete) without boxing a dummy value | Architect agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 0 | `Program.cs` exposes `public partial class Program` | Required by `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` in the Tests project | Architect agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 1 | `DeleteTicket` has no Request or Response DTO | No body is submitted; service returns `Task<Result>` (void); 204 No Content on success | Architect agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 1 | `GetTicketById` has no Request DTO | `id` is a route parameter passed directly to the service method | Architect agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 1 | `TicketListItem` co-defined in `ListTicketsResponse.cs` | Used only by `ListTicketsResponse`; no reason for a separate file | Architect agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 1 | `ITicketRepository.GetAllAsync()` takes no filter params | Service layer handles filtering/pagination on the returned collection; keeps repo interface minimal | Architect agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 2 | `Ticket.TransitionTo/CanBeDeleted/ApplyUpdate` are `public` | Service is in a different assembly (Application); `internal` would not cross the assembly boundary | Developer agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 2 | `ListTickets` controller binds individual `[FromQuery]` params instead of `[FromQuery] ListTicketsRequest` | Positional records require primary-constructor binding; individual params give default values for `page`/`pageSize` | Developer agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 2 | `UpdateAsync` uses `TryGetValue` + direct indexer assignment | `TryUpdate` requires the old value; since the entity is mutated in-place before the call, the indexer assignment is the correct single-step write | Developer agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 3 | `IFormFile` validation done inline in controller, no separate validator class | `IFormFile` is an ASP.NET Core type; adding a framework reference to Application layer would violate Clean Architecture. Inline validation keeps Application independent | Developer agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 3 | `BulkAddAsync` returns `IReadOnlyList<Result<Ticket>>` (one per input) | Enables per-record success/failure tracking for non-atomic partial import without a custom result type | Developer agent |
| 2026-05-06 | 3 | `TicketImportService` lives in Application/Services and depends on parser interfaces | Parser interfaces are Application contracts; keeping the coordinator in Application preserves Clean Architecture — parsers are infrastructure details behind those interfaces | Developer agent |
| 2026-05-08 | 4 | `KeywordClassifier` placed in `Infrastructure/Services/`; `IClassificationService` in `Application/Interfaces/` | Classifier is an infrastructure detail (pure keyword logic); the interface lives in Application so TicketService stays decoupled from the concrete implementation | Developer agent |
| 2026-05-08 | 4 | `AutoClassifyRequest` carries optional `CategoryOverride`/`PriorityOverride`; classifier still runs to produce confidence and reasoning | Overrides substitute only the category/priority fields; keywords and confidence reflect actual text analysis regardless | Developer agent |
| 2026-05-08 | 4 | `UpdateClassificationAsync` added to `ITicketRepository` as a focused method | Keeps the intent explicit at the interface boundary; internally calls `ApplyClassification` on the domain entity | Developer agent |
| 2026-05-08 | 4 | `AutoClassify: bool = false` appended as last positional param on `CreateTicketRequest` | Default `false` means the existing contract is unchanged for callers that omit it; classification runs in-process on the same ticket instance already stored | Developer agent |
| 2026-05-08 | 4 | `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` added to Infrastructure.csproj | Infrastructure project is a plain .NET SDK project; logging abstractions are not in the base SDK and must be declared explicitly | Developer agent |

## Open Questions

The following questions **must be answered before Phase 2 coding starts**. Unresolved questions become assumptions that must be logged in the Decision Log.

| # | Question | Impact | Default assumption if unanswered |
|---|----------|--------|----------------------------------|
| Q1 | Should `POST /tickets` with `AutoClassify: true` fail if classification fails, or succeed and return the ticket without classification? | Phase 2 + Phase 4 | Succeed without classification; classification is best-effort |
| Q2 | What exact status transitions are allowed? (Can a ticket move from `waiting_customer` back to `in_progress`?) | Phase 1 Errors.cs, Phase 2 domain entity | Only forward transitions; no backward movement |
| Q3 | Is `POST /tickets/import` atomic (all-or-nothing) or partial-success? | Phase 3 repository + response DTO | Partial-success; return summary with per-row errors |
| Q4 | Does `GET /tickets` support pagination? If so, what parameters (page/size vs cursor)? | Phase 1 DTOs, Phase 2 ListTickets | Yes, page-number + page-size (`?page=1&size=20`) |
| Q5 | What filtering fields does `GET /tickets` support? | Phase 1 `ListTicketsRequest.cs` | Category, Priority, Status, AssignedTo |
| Q6 | Is the confidence score a keyword-hit ratio, TF-IDF, or something else? | Phase 4 `KeywordClassifier` | Simple keyword-hit ratio: matched keywords / total keywords checked |
| Q7 | Should deleted tickets be hard-deleted from the in-memory store, or soft-deleted with a `DeletedAt` timestamp? | Phase 1 entity fields, Phase 2 repository | Hard delete (remove from ConcurrentDictionary) |
| Q8 | What is the maximum file size for `/tickets/import`? | Phase 3 validator | 10 MB |
| Q9 | Should classification decisions be logged to console, a file, or a separate in-memory store? | Phase 4 `KeywordClassifier` | Console (`ILogger<T>`) only |
| Q10 | Are `tags` free-form strings or constrained to a defined set? | Phase 1 entity + validator | Free-form strings, no constraint beyond non-null |
